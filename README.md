# The Image Size Reduction Script!

This is very simple Python script that you can run on your terminal to reduce the size of any and all image files. 

# Steps

1. Open your terminal and run the following command

` git clone https://github.com/aaryamanpatel/Image-Size-Reduction.git `

    This should've downloaded this script on your computer under the folder name "Image-Size-Reduction"

2. Open the *image_size_reducation.py* file on your preferred text editor, like VS Code or Notepad++

3. Change the variable `folder_path` with the location of your folder containing the images
(It will be in a format like "C:\Users\AP\Photography")

4. You can update the image reduction size by changing the number in the variable "new_width" and "new_height". It is at a default of **30%**

5. Finally, just run the script and it will make a reduced copy of all the images in your folder and save it in a new subfolder called **Reduced"**

    Before
</p>

<!-- ![Before](/before.png) -->

**Before**

<p align="center">
    <img src="/after.png" alt="After Reduction">
    <p style="font-weight:bold">After!</p>
</p>

<!-- ![After](/after.png) -->

**After**

## Enjoy and share your reduced size images!
